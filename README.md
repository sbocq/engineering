 # Laws, Principles & Quotes
 
 ## Laws
 
  - Hyrum’s law
    - "With a sufficient number of users of an API, it does not matter what you promise in
      the contract: all observable behaviors of your system will be depended on by
      somebody."
  - Ahmdal's law
    - "the overall performance improvement gained by optimizing a single part of a system
      is limited by the fraction of time that the improved part is actually used."
  - Goodhart's law
    - "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure."
  - Seb's law

    - "The simplest explanation is usually the best one."
 - Chesterton's fence
    - "If you don’t see the use of it, I certainly won’t let you clear it away. Go away and

  - C. A. R. Hoare
    - "There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so 
      simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it

  - Alan Perlis
    - "There are two ways to write error-free programs; only the third one works."
  - Alan Perlis
    - "Simplicity does not precede complexity, but follows it."
  - Rich Hikey

 # Teams Formation Principles
 
  - Purpose
    - Focus on customer, technology, sustainability & quality
  - Cognitive load
    - Minimize set of priorities, knowledge domains, goals and tech. stacks
  - Autonomy & Ownership
    - Collective goals
      - Collective agreement on achievable priorities, goals & deliverables
    - Independent lifecycle
      - Can deliver value at a steady-flow, at their own pace, ensure quality and maintain it.
      - Invest in cleaning up tech. debt, learnings & investigations
    - Multi-disciplinary/cross-functional team, sized appropriately
      - Products, Operations, DevOps, Dev, Platform, Test, Technologies, ...
      - Not more than 9 members (Dunbar's number)
      - Combines experts and generalists
        - In small teams, members may endorse multiple roles
    - Limited dependencies & external communication interfaces
    - Quick to correct course of action based on feedback and issues
  - Lifespan & evolution
    - Conway's law: "Organizations which design systems... are constrained to produce design
      which are copies of the communication structure of these organizations"
    - Squads must be stable
    - Squads must evolve as design changes and improves
    - Ideally small and long lived
      - But may aim to disband and/or leave a sustainable products behind
  - Evaluation
    - Ability to deliver
    - Cognitive load score
      - Do you feel like you're effective and able to respond in a timely fashion to the work you are asked to do? [1]
        - Score: 1:Low, 5:High
        - Above 3 means high cognitive load
          - Team must increase
          - Or interface and dependencies must be simplified to split the team
